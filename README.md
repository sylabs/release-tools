# Release Tools

This module contains common tools used to build, package and release code.

## Go Version Compatibility

This module aims to maintain support for the two most recent stable versions of Go. This corresponds to the Go [Release Maintenance Policy](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle#release-maintenance) and [Security Policy](https://golang.org/security), ensuring critical bug fixes and security patches are available for all supported language versions.
